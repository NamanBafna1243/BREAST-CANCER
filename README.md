<h1>BREAST-CANCER</h1></br>
<h3>Overview</h3></br>
<p>This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict breast cancer based on various medical features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about breast cancer patients, including tumor characteristics and other relevant medical data.</p></br>
<h3>Dataset</h3><br>
<p>The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset includes 569 instances and 30 features.</p></br>
<h3>Features</h3></br>
<p>The dataset includes the following features:

-Radius

-Texture

-Perimeter

-Area

-Smoothness

-Compactness

-Concavity

-Concave points

-Symmetry

-Fractal dimension</p></br>
<h3>Model</h3></br>
<p>The machine learning model used in this project is a Random Forest classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier and Logistic Regression. The model is trained on the dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.</p></br>
<p>Installation To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

-numpy

-pandas

-scikit-learn

-matplotlib</p></br>
<h3>Results</h3></br>
<p>The model achieves an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics are provided in the results section of the project.</p></br>
